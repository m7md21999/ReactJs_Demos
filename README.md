# ReactJs_Demos

Hello and welcome to my wonderfull journey :)!

I've always wanted to learn React JS, so here is my whole journey learning React and coding in Javascript. 

I'll be buliding simple apps in this repo and documenting everthing I do , so don't be surprised by the silly commit comments :d.

This is will be a self-learning repo where I am going to build and code based on courses, videos, documents, articles, etc I find online, which I will be referencing below.

My main goal is to be proficient and being able to build apps with React library.
